# Language-Detection
Script detection app in JS

### `Demo` https://tidbitsjs.github.io/Language-Detection/

#

Made with JS & JSON data, this module, when gets any text as input, detects its script, i.e., the origin of that language. 
For example, when given 'English' text as input, it will print out "Latin" as its script and rest for others.
